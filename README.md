## Final Considerations
 - This project is purely for educational purposes and should not be used as an actual webservice.
 - As developer for embedded systems and not having worked with java web applications for years,
   my knowledge in Java-based web applications is severely limited.
   Unfortunately, the requirement for this subject is a web-application.
   If it is possible, this requirement should be changed in the future.
