# Introduction and Goals

This project serves as my examination project for the university subject of Software Quality Assurance.
The goal is to show the usage of several types of quality assurance in software systems,
including but not limited to Unittesting, Integration testing, Acceptance testing, Documentation, etc.

The primary project requirements are:
 - The software must offer a REST-Service
 - The software must utilize an external REST-Service
 - The software must access a database
 - The software must be written in Java, C# or NodeJS

In consideration of the requirements, the project presented here will offer a REST-Service
to extend metadata about IP-Addresses, gathered using [IPAPI](IPAPI.co), with custom information fields.
In short, adding custom information to WHOIS entries.

## Final Considerations
 - This project is purely for educational purposes and should not be used as an actual webservice.
 - As developer for embedded systems, my knowledge in Java-based web web applications is severely limited.
