# 02. Architecture Constraints

The constraints listed here will severely influence the projects development
and architecture. Some of these constraints are set by the lecturer,
some come naturally with the projects technology stack.

As mentioned in the introduction, a few requirements are set for the project.
Narrowing the lists of choices down to single choices and expanding the list,
the following architectural constraints are the result:

 - The software must offer a REST-Service
 - The software must utilize an external REST-Service
 - The software must access a database
 - The software must be written in Java
 - The software architecture should work well with spring boot
 - The software architecture should offer very high testability
 - The project must utilize an external build system

Additionally, the documentation must adhere to arc42 guidelines.
